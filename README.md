# TicTacToe with AI

Training project from the [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)

## Instruction

Commands:
- `exit` terminate the program
- `start` command should take two parameters: who will play X and who will play O. Two parameters are possible for now: `user` to play as a human and `easy` to play as an easy level AI.
